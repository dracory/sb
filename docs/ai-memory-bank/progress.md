# Progress: Simplified SQL Builder (SB)

## What Works
- Basic SQL building functionalities (CREATE, DROP, INSERT, DELETE) are implemented.
- Database wrapper with transaction management is in place.
- Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite dialects is present.

## What's Left to Build
- VIEW creation and deletion functionality.
- Comprehensive testing for all functionalities.
- Documentation for all functionalities.

## Current Status
- Core functionality is stable and well-tested
- Memory bank documentation has been updated
- Good test coverage for main features
- API is consistent across database dialects
- Documentation covers all major features

## Known Issues
- Some edge cases in complex queries may need additional testing
- Documentation could be expanded with more examples
- Performance with very large result sets could be optimized
- Some database-specific features may not be fully abstracted
