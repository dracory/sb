# Progress: Simplified SQL Builder (SB)

## What Works
- Basic SQL building functionalities (CREATE, DROP, INSERT, DELETE) are implemented.
- Database wrapper with transaction management is in place.
- Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite dialects is present.

## What's Left to Build
- VIEW creation and deletion functionality.
- Comprehensive testing for all functionalities.
- Documentation for all functionalities.

## Current Status
- Initial project inspection and memory bank setup are complete.
- SELECT query building functionality is implemented.
- Code review and refactoring are pending.
- Read all memory bank files.
- Identified potential areas for improvement: error handling, code duplication, testing, SQL injection, performance, and documentation.
- Completed initial project inspection and memory bank setup.
- Refactored the quote function to reduce code duplication and verified tests passed.

## Known Issues
- The library lacks comprehensive testing.
- Documentation is incomplete.
- The approach for supporting multiple database dialects needs to be evaluated.
- Tests have been run and passed.
