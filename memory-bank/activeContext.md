# Active Context: Simplified SQL Builder (SB)

## Current Work Focus
Initial project inspection and memory bank setup.

## Recent Changes
- Created the initial memory bank structure and populated core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md).

## Next Steps
- Reviewed the existing code (builder.go and builder_test.go) to understand the current implementation of the SQL builder and database wrapper.
- Identified that the code uses a builder pattern and supports multiple dialects.
- The tests cover various functionalities, including table creation, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, index creation, and view operations.
- The tests use the DIALECT constants to test dialect-specific SQL generation.
- The code review and refactoring are pending.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Determined to stick with the current approach (interface and struct implementations) for supporting multiple database dialects, but refactor to reduce code duplication.
- Evaluated the performance of the database wrapper and identified potential optimizations: caching and batching.
- Decided on a testing strategy: expand existing tests, test coverage, integration tests, database-specific tests, and fuzz testing.
