# Active Context: Simplified SQL Builder (SB)

## Current Work Focus
Initial project inspection and memory bank setup.

## Recent Changes
- Created the initial memory bank structure and populated core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md).

## Next Steps
- Review the existing code to understand the current implementation of the SQL builder and database wrapper.
- Identify areas for improvement or refactoring.
- Create a `progress.md` file to track the project's status and remaining tasks.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Determine the best approach for supporting multiple database dialects (code generation vs. templating).
- Evaluate the performance of the database wrapper and identify potential optimizations.
- Decide on a testing strategy for ensuring the library's correctness and compatibility.
